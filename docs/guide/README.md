# Introduction

The beauty of Web3 is that everyone owns their data, but accessing and displaying their data is a difficult thing. Each application has its own data specifications and access methods, it's hard for developers to adapt to all of them one by one. That's why Unidata.

Unidata gets data from a variety of platforms and data sources on the front end, converts it to the same specifications, and gives developers a unified API to access it. Web3 development has never been so easy.
